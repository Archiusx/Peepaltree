# 🌳 BIT Digital Forest

**BIT Digital Forest** is an educational, interactive web-based project developed by students of **Bajaja institute of Technology , Wardha (BIT Wardha)**. This initiative brings together the beauty of nature and the power of the web to digitally represent 36 unique trees planted across the campus. Each tree is given its own dedicated webpage, accessible via QR codes, with detailed information and visual content.

## 🚀 Project Highlights

- 🌿 **Individual Webpages for Trees**  
  Each tree (e.g., Banyan, Peepal, Neem) has its own dedicated HTML page hosted on Netlify (e.g., `https://banyantree.netlify.app`).

- 📱 **QR Code Integration**  
  Every tree has a unique QR code placed near it in the real world. When scanned, users are taken to that tree’s informative webpage.

- 🎨 **Modern UI/UX Design**  
  Fully responsive layout, dark mode support, animations, gradient backgrounds, and elegant fonts for an engaging user experience.

- 📚 **Educational Content**  
  Pages include sections like:
  - Scientific and Common Name
  - Tree Features
  - Traditional & Medicinal Uses
  - Environmental Impact
  - Chemistry Behind the Tree
  - Fun Facts and Myths
  - Gallery with Images and Videos

- 💾 **LocalStorage Integration**  
  Tracks user interactions like completed sections or visited tree pages.
